# HCI: Lecture: 4.1 Heuristic Evalution

Heuristic Evaluation (HE)
Heuristic Evaluation is a critique based approach
peer critique before user tests, redesign or release
Begin with a clean goal

Heuristic Evaluation goal is to find problems with design and works well with paper or lo fi techniques

### Nielsen's 10 Heuristics:

1.  Visibility of system status
2.  Match between system and the world 
3.  User control and freedom
4.  Consistency and standards
5.  Error prevention
6.  Recognition rather than recall
7.  Flexibility and efficiency of use
8.  Aesthetic & minimal design
9.  Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from error    
10.  Help and documentation
    
Give evaluator the tasks with visibility principals as points to evaluate against.
Use violations of the Heuristic Evaluation to fix
Heuristic Evaluation is better because it is pre-interpreted, but there are alternatives.

### Steps:

1.  Get the evaluator up to speed on the domain and scenario
2.  Evaluate  
3.  Evaluator should go through the task twice
    
Provide a severity rating to the problem found and combine for frequency, impact and persistence.

### Nielsens' Severity Rating:

-   0 = don't agree this is usability
-   1 = cosmetic
-   2 = minor usability
-   3 = major usability, must fix
-   4 = catastrophic, imperative to fix
