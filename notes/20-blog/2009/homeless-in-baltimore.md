# Homeless in Baltimore

I passed a homeless person in Baltimore - sign in hand, yesterday.  I thought I should give her something, but she was across the median.  I drove a bit down MLK Blvd and came to another stop.  This time a homeless man, again with sign in hand.  I found myself not able to look at him directly and the feeling of giving vanished.  And it vanished to the point that I could not look at him.  I immediately thought of Kamala and what she would have done.  I thought, she’d be more like Buddha - coming out of the palace wall and upon seeing the person, would stop to give them something.  I did not.  I kept driving.  I’m not sure what happened between the first person and the second, but I’m a bothered by it.
