I'm sitting here with one foot out the door for one project and one foot in the door of the next.  I'm looking at comps from the new gig and answering questions about restricted access to data for the old.  Drum lessons in the afternoon, Bella here in the evening, Ma comes by tomorrow.  Bell Choir rehearsal on Sunday.  A busy weekend for sure
