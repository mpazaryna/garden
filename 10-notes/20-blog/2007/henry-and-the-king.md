So, the other night - Henry needs to practice some lines for the upcoming performance of "The King and I" where he plays the son. He is one of the first to appear and the first scene is his "big one." So - we sit down and start working. I'm taking all of the parts and he's got the dialog pretty good and we are mostly having a real good time. We get to the song "Whenever I Feel Afraid" and I say something like - 'Ok, now its the song." He quickly responds, "You've got to sing the song, I've got some cues in there." I'm not sure if he's goofing on me or what, but he takes this pretty seriously - so I start singing. I'm not sure what came over me - but I jumped up and started doing a modified dance that could only be characterized as something out of a Mel Brooks production. He started laughing real hard and then I started laughing even harder and really hammed it up. With that, he started doing a breakdance version of the tune and we both started to get tears in our eyes from laughing so hard. These are the times you should rememberâ€¦..
