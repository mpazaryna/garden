# Free Yourself

> Day after day you, you prove that you are a slave to your environment and habits. Instead, day after day you should affirm: ‘I will not remain behind the bars of bad habits, the bars of fate.’ You forged those bars, you must break them. You must be jailbreakers—breaking out of this prison of flesh. Escape from every jail cell of bad habits, attachment, emotion, desires, life and death. The bars of this jail in which your soul is imprisoned can be severed with the saw of wisdom. The more you saw at them in meditation, the freer you will become through the power of God.

**Swami Yogananda, “The Divine Romance”**
