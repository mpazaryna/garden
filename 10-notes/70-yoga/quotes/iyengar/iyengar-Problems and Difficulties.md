# Problems and Difficulties

> Do you have a problem part that makes practice difficult for you?  An injured knee?  A stiff back?  That is your problem child.  Learn how to deal with it and how to nurture it, as you would a child that needs extra love and attention.  Do not bother about failures either.  Failures in life lead one toward determination and in having the necessary philosophical approach.  Be detached.  Look at me, I am not afraid, and I know there is no way to spare my difficulties. For me if it came yesterday, so much the better.  If it comes after 20 years, it is also good.  All is well.

BKS Iyengar, *Light On Life* (New York: Rodale, 2005) 55.
