# Same Old Mistakes

I hope as you read on you will begin to understand that if you too live and practice yoga in the right way and with the right attitude, far greater benefits and more radical changes will take place than mere physical flexibility. There is no progress toward ultimate freedom without transformation, and this is the key issue in all people’s lives, whether they practice yoga or not. If we can understand how our mind and heart works, we have a chance to answer the question, “Why do I keep making the same old mistakes?” — location: [256](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00CSDWZJQ&location=256)
