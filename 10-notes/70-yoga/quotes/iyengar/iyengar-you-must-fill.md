# You must fill...

> You must fill every inch of your body with the asana from your chest and arms and legs to the tips of your fingers and toes so the asana radiates from the core of your body and fills the entire diameter and circumference of your limbs.  You must feel your intelligence, your awareness, and your consciousness in every inch of your body.
