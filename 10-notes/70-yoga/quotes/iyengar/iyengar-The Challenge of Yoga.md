# The Challenge of Yoga

> The challenge of yoga is to go beyond our limits - within reason. We continually expand the frame of the mind by using the canvas of the body.  It is as if you were to stretch a canvas more and create a larger surface for a painting.  But we must respect the present form of our body.  If we pull too fast or too much at once, we will rip the canvas.  If the practices of today damages the practice of tomorrow, it is not a correct practice.
