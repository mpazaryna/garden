# The greatest thing our soul can do

> “The greatest thing our soul can do in this world is to see its ideal and follow it. Life involves both passions and poise; fears and courage; suffering and exaltation; doubts and assurances. Unless one finds a spiritual philosophy which he can serve with devotion and loyalty he cannot realize his soul’s yearning, its quest for unity and peace.”

—Swami Kamalananda, 
“Reflections on Still Waters”
