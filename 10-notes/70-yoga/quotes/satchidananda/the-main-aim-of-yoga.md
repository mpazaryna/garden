# The Main Aim of Yoga

Author: Swami Satchidananda
Blurb: Remember, the main aim or goal of Yoga is to have good control over the mind. If you keep the mind clean and serene that’s all that is necessary to reflect the inner light or the God within. It’s not easy to calm the mind. We can calm the mind through the physical senses, the body, and the environment. Be careful about what you allow into your system and surroundings so that you don’t do anything to disturb your inner peace.
