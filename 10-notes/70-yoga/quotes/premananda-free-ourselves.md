# Free Ourselves

>”By making ourselves free from the domination of the senses, the finite mind, the limited intellect, and the ego, we ultimately free ourselves from all the conditions of duality, and finally regain our original state of perfection. Every soul is constantly struggling to regain its absolute freedom.”

**Swami Premananda, “The Law of Self-Manifestation”**
