# On Serenity

> "The blessed peacefulness of heart is serenity. The heart is the abode of love and pure emotion. Love that reveals the divinity of soul, and emotion that unfolds the qualities of the attributes of God induce serenity within us. Peace of soul is the fruit of serenity.”

Swami Premananda
“One Hundred and One Noble Qualities”
