# Ram Dass on Faith

> When the faith is strong enough, it is sufficient just to _be_. It’s a journey towards simplicity, towards quietness, towards a kind of joy that is not in time. It’s a journey that has taken us from primary identification with our body and our psyche, on to an identification with God, and ultimately beyond identification.
