# Words of Wisdom, Ram Dass

>To live consciously you must have the courage to go inside yourself to find out who you really are, to understand that behind all of the masks of individual differences you are a being of beauty, of love, of awareness.  
>
>When Christ said, “The kingdom of heaven is within” he wasn’t just putting you on. When Buddha said, “Each person is the Buddha,” he was saying the same thing. Until you can allow your own beauty, your own dignity, your own being, you cannot free another.  
>
>So if I were giving people one instruction, I would say work on yourself. Have compassion for yourself. Allow yourself to be beautiful and all the rest will follow.
