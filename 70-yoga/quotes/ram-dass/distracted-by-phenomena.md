We’re all distracted by phenomena, everything that’s going on all the time.  
  
Mindfulness is one of the practices for slowing down our lives, for finding a way inside, for concentrating self-awareness. It can help us to quiet down and find our way into who we are.   
  
Finding our true self is a lifelong search. It’s not called practice for nothing. You actually have to tread on the path to get somewhere. Not that there’s anywhere to go, it’s just about becoming more here, being more present in this moment.   
  
Once we begin to explore our own psyche and mind and heart, we begin to appreciate that everybody else is in the same situation. We’re not so different. Each of us is an individual awareness living with our particular karma or family situation or what we do, our cultural milieu. Awareness itself is something that we all share. It’s what makes us human and divine.
