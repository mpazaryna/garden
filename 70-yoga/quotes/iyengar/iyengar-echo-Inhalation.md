# Echo Inhalation

Author: BKS Iyengar
Blurb: Exhale slowly and fully.  Pause.  Then exhale again.  There is always a slight residue left in the lungs.  In that residue is to be found the sludge of toxic memory and ego.  In that brief and further exhalation, let them go - and experience an even deeper state of relief from burden, of peace and emptiness.  In inhalation we experience the full "I" human potential fulfilled and raised like a brimming cup in offering or oblation to the Cosmic Divine.  In exhalation we experience the empty "I," the divine void, a nothingness that is complete and perfect, a death that is not the end of life.  Try it.  Exhale slowly and fully. Pause and then exhale again.
