# Declaration of Freedom

> Whatever may seem to bind or limit you, Declare yourself free from it now. There is nothing in the outer world, No person, condition, no circumstance That can take away the freedom Which is yours in spirit. Instead of wishing that you were free To live your life differently, Accept the truth that right now You are free. Free to change your thinking Free to change your outlook on life, Free to be all that you long to be. Make this a day of freedom. Spiritual freedom. Declare yourself free from anxiety and fear, Free from any belief in luck or limitation.

Swami Satyananda Saraswati
