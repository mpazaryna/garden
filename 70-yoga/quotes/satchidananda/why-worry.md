# Why Worry

Author: Swami Satchidananda
Blurb: Why worry what others say of you? You should know who you are. If someone says you are always a wonderful person, will that make it so? If another says you are a horrible person, will you be that?  Should somebody else tell you who you are? No. Don’t worry what others say. If you know yourself, you are free from this botheration.
