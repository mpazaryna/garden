# A Perfect Yogic Action

> A perfect yogic action should not bring harm to anybody, including yourself. Before doing something, consider its effect on your mind. See whether it will bring you anxiety. By disturbing another person’s mind, won’t you also be disturbed? Your actions should be completely harmless, and, at the same time, bring at least some benefit to someone. Then they are perfectly yogic.
