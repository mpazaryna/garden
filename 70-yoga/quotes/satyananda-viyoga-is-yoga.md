# Viyoga Is Yoga

> Swami Satyananda has said â€œIt is usually argued that yoga is union, but it must be remembered that it is disunion first. It is the process of avoiding the conjunction between purusha and prakriti. Pantanjali emphasizes the fact that yoga is viyoga, disunion, disjunction. So Pantajali has really explained yoga in terms of viyoga, and we must understand it properly. The point is simple. With the practices of different aspects of yoga, step by step, impurities of the personality are destroyed, resulting in spiritual illumination. This results in true, deeper awareness of reality. With this awareness of reality, avidya and prakriti both disappear. In this sense, therefore, yoga is not joining, yoga is disjoining. We have to transcend the realm of prakriti, only then can purusha can be realized completely. Then there is no bhoga, i.e. objective awareness, because avidya is finished.
