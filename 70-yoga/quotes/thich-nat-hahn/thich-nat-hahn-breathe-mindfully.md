# Come Back To Yourself..

> When you come back to yourself and breathe mindfully, your mind’s attention has only one object, your breath. If you continue to breathe in and out mindfully, you maintain that state of presence and freedom. Your mind will be clearer and you will make better decisions. It’s much better to make a decision when your mind is clear and free rather than in the sway of fear, anger, and worries.
